# Researching HTML elements

The web is a constantly evolving entity. As we build more ambitious products or learn from our collective needs and mistakes the industry continually evolves the HTML specification by adding new elements or deprecating legacy elements.

We will inevitably come across unfamiliar HTML elements or elements for which we do not fully understand the meaning and/or use. The best place to find these answer is the web itself, the open and free documentation on the web gets better every day.

Let's say we come across an unfamiliar element. We will use the `<samp>` element for our example. We can simply google `samp html element,` and we will find anything we would ever need to know about the element.

If we select the second search result, we will view the Mozilla Developer Network (**likely the best HTML, JS and CSS documentation source on the internet**) documentation for the `<samp>` element.
